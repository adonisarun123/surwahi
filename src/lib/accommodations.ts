    longDescription: `Perched among the treetops, our Forest Canopy Suite offers an unparalleled view of the forest ecosystem. This spacious 45 sqm suite features floor-to-ceiling windows that frame the ever-changing forest landscape, from morning mists to golden hour light filtering through ancient sal trees.

The suite is designed with sustainability at its core, featuring solar-powered air cooling, rainwater-fed bathroom facilities, and furniture crafted from locally sourced, sustainably harvested wood. Wake to the symphony of over 200 bird species that call this forest home.

The elevated position provides natural ventilation and cooling, while the private balcony extends your living space into the canopy itself. Perfect for morning meditation, afternoon reading, or evening wildlife watching with provided binoculars.`,
