    postBody: `<h3 id="banjar-river-general-information-and-facts"><strong>Banjar River general information and facts</strong></h3><p>The topography of the Kanha Tiger Reserve (KTR) is intersected by two river valleys – the <strong>Banjar river</strong> valley on the west and the <strong>Hallon river </strong>valley on the east.</p><h4><strong>Banjar River origin and location</strong></h4><p>A tributary of Narmada, the Banjar River flows through the Buffer Zone – about 64 km from the Park’s western gate along the north-western direction – and is regarded as the life of KTR because it is an important source of water for the thriving<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240119112422/https://www.surwahi.com/uncategorized/tree-life-of-surwahi-social-kanha/"> flora</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240119112422/https://www.surwahi.com/blog/the-indian-fig-tree-in-surwahi-social-kanha/">fauna of the Kanha National Park</a>, on the western boundary of the Park.</p><ul><li>It is one of the main <strong>tributaries of River Narmada</strong> (the fifth largest river in India) in central India.</li><li>It originates at the Malajkhand region, along the state borders of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.</li><li>The catchment area of the river is about 1520 sq. Km and consists of mainly Sal trees.</li><li>The Kanha Tiger Reserve is located on the banks of the Banjar River.</li><li>It crosses the district headquarters of Kanha in Mandla.</li><li>It is a stream belonging to <strong>Class H – Hydrographic</strong>.</li><li>The river is at an elevation of 452 metres above sea level.</li><li>The geographical coordinates of the Banjar River are 22°36’0″ N and 80°22’0″ E.</li></ul><h4><strong>River Banjar merging with Narmada at Mandla</strong></h4><p>The Banjar River merges with the Narmada River between Ramnagar and Mandla districts in Madhya Pradesh. Narmada flows through the town of Dindori, Sarasdoli, Singarpur and Ramnagar ruins in Mandla before the Banjar River which is one of its major tributaries joins it from the left-hand side near Mandla.</p><h4><strong>Bridges and waterfalls of Banjar River</strong></h4><p><strong>Bridges</strong></p><p>Several bridges have been constructed across the Banjar River. The Baglipat Bride lies near Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha. The Banjar River cuts through the plains of Madhya Pradesh and acts as a divider between the villages of Surwahi and Sarkeha. The Baglipat Bridge is built over the Banjar River and is very close to the Baglipat Mandir. The Bridge connects both the villages. The place is about 300 metres or 4 minutes’ walk from Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha which is located on the Surwahi side of the River. During heavy rains and the monsoon season, when the volume of water increases in the Banjar River, the view from the Bridge of the roaring River is amazing and worth a hundred clicks. The proximity of SSEK from the bridge can be easily gauged from the pictorial depiction below.</p><p><strong>Waterfalls of the Banjar River</strong></p><p>The Ghugara, also locally called Ghogra Waterfall at Ghogharikhapa Check Dam is one of the amazing places for tourists to visit in and around the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240119112422/https://www.surwahi.com/kanha-national-park/">Kanha National Park</a>. This waterfall is part of the Banjar River. The waterfall is located at Jamsavli near the Jamsvali Temple. Surrounded by stones of all sizes and a rocky terrain, that can get quite slippery during monsoons and heavy rains, the waterfall is marked by cool clear water that provides for the perfect family outing. People from all over flock here except the hot summers. The sight is awesome due to its exclusive location and the scampering water that moves through the natural rocky landscape unharmed by human intervention.</p><p>Places near to the waterfall include Paradsinga, Mohgaon, Sausar, Berdi, Rangari, MP Border Check post, Lodhikheda, Chhindwara Road, Kolar Dam, Ghogri, Lohangi, Khekra Nala Dam and Lohgad.</p><h4><strong>Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha and the Banjar River</strong> <strong>connection</strong></h4><p><strong>Proximity of Banjar to Surwahi Social Kanha</strong></p><p>Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha, an upcoming site that is a true reflection of eco-friendly and sustainable tourism project is in the Paraswada Tehsil in Surwahi Village. Since the River Banjar flows through the village, the site of SSEK is near the river. Guests staying at SSEK can literally walk down towards the river and enjoy the serene tranquillity of the place broken by the natural sounds of the flowing river.</p><p>The Sanduk Nala, a small stream cuts through the Surwahi region from the other side to meet and merge with the Banjar River at about 500 meters from the location of Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha. The merging point of the two water bodies being so close to SSEK is enhanced by the fact that the Sanduk Nala passes very close to the SSEK site before meeting the River. This adds value to the eco-tourist site of SSEK – with two of the region’s mighty natural elements winding so close by, guests staying at the site can immerse themselves in the innate essence of Mother Earth and the surroundings, away from the hustle-bustle of city life.</p><p>The satellite picture below depicts the position of Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha, located strategically between the Banjar River on the right and the Sanduk Nala on the left.</p><h5><strong>The emotional connection between Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha, the Banjar River and Kanha</strong></h5><p>For travellers and tourists looking out to experience a holistic and fulfilling ecotourism experience, the upcoming <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240119112422/https://www.surwahi.com/best-homestays-of-kanha/">Surwahi Social Ecoestate Kanha Homestay</a> is the perfect answer. How?</p><p>Kanha and Banjar are entwined in a unique manner with this upcoming project like never. While resident guests at Surwahi might be checking into the property primarily for the Kanha National Park, many of their escapades and activities at the Homestay will revolve around the river, its banks, the bridge, the waterfall and the Sanduk Nala.

    postBody: `<h3>Exploring the Rich Fauna of Kanha National Park: Beyond Tigers to Barasingha and More</h3><p>Nestled in the heart of Madhya Pradesh, the Kanha National Park stands as a testament to India's diverse and thriving wildlife. While it is renowned as a Tiger Reserve, there's a lesser-known but equally captivating side to Kanha—the vibrant array of deer and antelope species that call this sanctuary home. In this detailed exploration, we delve into the distinctive features, conservation efforts, and the fascinating stories behind some of Kanha's most iconic inhabitants.</p><h4>The Distinction Between Deer and Antelopes</h4><h5>Horns and Antlers</h5><ul><li><strong>Deer:</strong> Possess antlers, exclusive to male deer, shed annually, and branched.</li><li><strong>Antelope:</strong> Bears horns made of living bone, permanent, and unbranched.</li></ul><h5>Species Family</h5><ul><li><strong>Deer:</strong> Belongs to the family Cervidae.</li><li><strong>Antelope:</strong> Part of the family Bovidae.</li></ul><h4>The Barasingha – A Majestic Deer Species</h4><p>Popularly known as the swamp deer, the Barasingha (Rucervus duvaucelli) graces the landscapes of south-western Nepal, northern India, and central India, with Kanha as one of its vital habitats. The distinguishing feature of the Barasingha is its antlers, boasting more than three tines, earning it the name ""Barasingha"" meaning twelve-tined.</p><p>The challenges of constant poaching pushed this majestic species to the brink of extinction. Thanks to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, Kanha has become a stronghold for Barasingha conservation, leading to its designation as the state animal of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.</p><p>In 2017, Kanha National Park set a unique precedent by adopting Bhoorsingh the Barasingha as its official mascot. Crafted by renowned cartoonist Rohan Chakravarty, this initiative aimed to raise awareness, especially among the younger generation, about the importance of preserving this unique species.</p><h4>Sambar Deer – A Stalwart in Kanha's Wilderness</h4><p>The Sambar deer (Rusa unicolour) stands as one of the largest native deer species in Kanha. Its presence is a common sight in the lush surroundings of the Tiger Reserve. Identified by chestnut marks on the underparts and rump, the Sambar deer plays a crucial role in the ecosystem, serving as a favored prey for the Royal Bengal Tiger.</p><h4>Barking Deer – The Omnivorous Marvel</h4><p>Scientifically known as Muntiacus Muntjak, the Barking Deer, or Kakar in Hindi, adds a unique flair to Kanha's biodiversity. Not endangered, this species boasts a versatile diet, including grass, eggs of birds, and small animals. Its distinctive barking sound lends it multiple names, emphasizing its adaptability in different environments.</p><h4>Chital or the Spotted Deer – A Visual Delight</h4><p>The Chital, also known as the spotted deer or Axis axis, graces Kanha National Park with its distinctive spotted appearance. Found in substantial numbers, these deer move in single file, displaying a breathtaking sight with their white-spotted upper parts. The antlers, a feature exclusive to male deer, add to the allure of this species.</p><h4>Chousingha – The Four-Horned Antelope</h4><p>In a league of its own, the four-horned antelope stands out with its unique feature of having four horns. Thriving in areas with dense grass cover, this herbivorous species finds protection under the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, contributing to the rich tapestry of Kanha's wildlife conservation efforts.</p><h4>Beyond Kanha: Exploring Other Deer and Antelope Species in India</h4><p>While Kanha is a haven for several deer and antelope species, India's vast subcontinent harbors other unique varieties not found within the park's boundaries. Some notable mentions include:</p><ul><li><strong>Sangai or Brow-Antlered Deer:</strong> Endangered, residing in the wetlands of Loktak Lake in Manipur.</li><li><strong>Leaf Deer:</strong> Exclusive to the thick forest regions of Noklal in Nagaland and Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh.</li><li><strong>Himalayan Goral:</strong> Thriving in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.</li><li><strong>Himalayan Serow:</strong> Native to the Himalayas, found in Sikkim.</li><li><strong>Indian Hog Deer:</strong> Exclusive to Kaziranga National Park, Assam.</li><li><strong>Himalayan Musk Deer:</strong> State animal of Uttarakhand, dwelling in the Himalayas.</li><li><strong>Black Buck:</strong> Spotted in Corbett, Bandhavgarh, and Velavadar National Parks.</li><li><strong>Chinkara or Indian Gazelle:</strong> Found in Ranthambore and Bandhavgarh National Park.</li><li><strong>Nilgai:</strong> Widespread in India, absent in eastern states and the Malabar coast.</li><li><strong>Red Deer or Hangul:</strong> Restricted to Dachigam National Park in Jammu &amp; Kashmir.</li></ul><p>Kanha National Park, with its multifaceted ecosystem, provides a glimpse into the rich diversity of deer and antelope species that grace the Indian subcontinent. From the majestic Barasingha to the resilient Sambar deer, each species contributes to the intricate balance of nature within the sanctuary's confines. As we celebrate the conservation successes of Kanha, let us also acknowledge the broader canvas of India's wildlife, where each species, whether thriving in Kanha or beyond, plays a vital role in maintaining the delicate harmony of our natural heritage.</p>`,
